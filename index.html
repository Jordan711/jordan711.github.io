            <p>Hi! I am a recent graduate who studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough. At a young age, I had developed an interest in tech (some of it can be seen in my YouTube channel linked below) and wanted to pursue a career related to software. This website is a portfolio of what I have achieved so far in my journey. If you would like to contact me or see more of my work, please feel free to click the icons at the bottom for my GitHub or LinkedIn.

            <p>During my co-op work term at CaseWare International Inc., after work, I wanted to learn some new web development frameworks. Since I have some full-stack web development experience from my previous work term, I decided to take some time to learn something that I am not familiar with, and that is Express.js on Node.js. Through some books and online tutorials, this is the result of my self-study throughout my co-op work term. I treated this project as a "sandbox", where I am free to experiment with new features and libraries to see what I can do with them and how to better use them.
            </p>
            <p>One notable "sub-feature" is the games that I have added. Prior to this, I have not done any formal game programming and, I decided to try to make some simple HTML5 games as sample content to put in this web application.
            </p>
            <p>This project was a review of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap but it also gave me the opportunity to explore Node.js, Express.js and Handlebars, as well as fully building a functional web application by myself for the first time. This allowed me to better understand what is happening behind the scenes, when users are accessing pages on the application, and making different requests to the server. Looking back, I am pretty happy to have worked on this project and I plan to continue using it to test out new techniques, libraries, or frameworks in the future.
            </p>

            <p class="title"><a href="https://github.com/Jordan711/jump-and-collect-game" target="_blank">Jump and Collect Game (2020)</a></p>
            <p>This project was actually inspired by an unfortunate event, the Adobe Flash Player's End of Life. Hearing that the flash player will no longer be supported saddened me, as online flash games played a large part of my childhood. As a child, I always wondered how game developers created the very games that I loved and enjoyed. Sadly, I have missed that opportunity. Despite this, there are also other methods of creating online games.
            </p>
            <p>HTML5 games are getting popular and while I am not too familiar with them, I wanted to explore this new territory and create a game of my own. When I searched up "How to make html5 game", one library that was mentioned quite a bit is the Phaser library. This led to me searching up its documentation and other tutorials in order to create my very first game with Phaser. The final result is the Jump and Collect Game (yes, very original name). The game consists of a block character collecting block coins, and to win, the block character must collect all the coins in the stage. It is a very simple game at this point, but I hope to add more features when I have time.
            </p>
            <p> It ain't much, but it's honest work.

            <p>I am in my final semester of university. So many different experiences ... so many different things learned. What's the best way for me to showcase my entire journey through university (other than just a resume)? How about a personal website too!
            </p>
            <p>Coincidentally, I am also taking a class on web development this semester so I thought it would be a great time to apply what I have learned (or re-learned ... it's been a while hehe) into creating my very own personal website. This project has also taught me a little bit about how domain names and hosting websites work. Prior to this, I would not have known how to put my website on the internet for everyone to see (About Me Web Application was unfortunately left out because of this).
            </p>
            <p> I do hope to continue updating this website as I pick up more skills or create more interesting side projects so I can keep you up to date!
